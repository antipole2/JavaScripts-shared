= Processing SignalK

https://github.com/antipole2/JavaScripts-shared/blob/373ad6dec5e7ae6672437c16b16ac9f7cbcbfe25/PointInPolygon/pointInPolygon.js[isPointInPolygon.js]

SignalK input can be processed in JavaScript.

The script can be copied into your own script or loaded from a file.

[source,javascript]
----
isPointInPolygon = require("~/myScripts/pointInPoligon.js");

isPointInPolygon({latitude:60, longitude:-1}, polygon);
----
returns true or false.

The polygon is an array of positions.  If the last is not the same as the first (a closed polygon) it assumes a connection between the first and last points.  The polygon can be any shape, even crossing in a figure of eight.

The position is compatible with that used in the JavaScript plugin and the polygon is as used in the array of points in a route.
