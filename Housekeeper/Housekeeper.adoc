== What this script addresses

A collection of OpenCPN waypoints and routes can become untidy and are not always what they seem.
This script analyses your waypoints and routes and presents a report.

It then presents a series of dialogues allowing you to fix various issues.

The script is structured in such a way that you can make the proposed changes and only save them back into OpenCPN at the end.


== What the script does

=== Fixes for waypoint and route names
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Issue|Explanation|Proposed fix

|Fix empty icon names|It is possible for points to have no icon name assigned, but this is not aparrent visually| Assigns an icon  (Circle by default).
|Name unnamed waypoints||Assigns names like 'Waypoint_1', Waypoint_2 etc. always ensuring the assigned name is unique.
|Uniquify waypoint names||Makes duplicated waypoint names unique by adding suffixes _1, _2 etc.
|Name unnamed routes||Assigns names like 'Route 1', 'Route 2' etc.
If the route has _From_ or _To_ attributes, these are used to construct the route name.  The constructed name is always unique.
|Uniquify route names||Makes duplicated route names unique by adding suffixes _1, _2 etc.
|Remove Goto routes|When you navigate to a waypoint/location, OpenCPN creates a one leg route with a name like 'Goto <waypoint name>'|These routes can be removed
|Remove routepoints removed from routes|When you create a route, OpenCPN adds routepoints with names 001, 002, 003 etc.
If you remove one of these routepoints from the route, it becomes a free-standing waypoint.|Freestanding waypoints with names like 0001, 002 and with an icon name of 'diamond' which are no longer included in any route can be removed.

=== Successive repeated routepoints
Suppose you have a route used to visit a series of lobster pots in two bays.  Your route might have routepoints like this:

. Home port
. Sandy Bay
. Pot 1
. Pot 2
. Sandy Bay
. Rocky Cove
. Pot A
. Pot B
. Rocky Cove
. Pot C
. Rocky Cove
. Home Port

Now suppose it is the end of the season.
You lift the pots an delete their marks.
You are now left with the route:

. Home port
. Sandy Bay
. Sandy Bay
. Rocky Cove
. Rocky Cove
. Rocky Cove
. Home Port

Housekeeper will spot this and remove the repeated routepoints, leaving you with:

. Home port
. Sandy Bay
. Rocky Cove
. Home Port

Now suppose you stop visiting Sandy Bay and Rocky Cove and remove them.
Your route would now be:

. Home port
. Home Port

Housekeeper will spot that when it removes the repeated point, you would be left with a singleton route with just a starting point and it will delete the route.

From v1.2, Housekeeper identifies a repeated point when its location is within the `nearby` distance from the previous point.  It no longer needs to be the same mark.

The above example may seem unlikely, but Housekeeper has found two real cases of a repeated routepoint in my routes.


=== Co-located waypoints
Housekeeper will identify multiple marks at the same lcation. There is an option at the start of the script

`nearby = 0.01;	//two points this close in nm regarded as at same position`

This specifies how close points need to be before they are regarded as at the same point.
You can adjust this to your own requirement.

NOTE: I use the term _waypoint_ to refer to a mark which exists independently of a route and which will be listed in the Waypoints tab of the Route & Mark Manager.
I use the term _routepoint_ to refer to a mark which exists only in a route.  Routepoints are not included in the list of waypoints.  When a route is deleted, its routepoints are also deleted unless they are being used in another route.  Any included waypoints are not deleted.  I here use the term _point_ when it may be either a waypoint or a routepoint.

When you add a routepoint to a route, OpenCPN will offer to use any nearby point.
If you accept this, the point may be shared by more than one route.
If you decline, you will have more than one point at this location.

==== Imported waypoints and routes

When I adopted OpenCPN, I exported my substantial library of waypoints from my old system (MacENC) as GPX files and imported them into OpenCPN.
I then imported my routes, imagining OpenCPN would link the waypoints into routes.

OpenCPN does not work like that.

When you add waypoints by importing them from a GPX file, OpenCPN creates new waypoints, even if waypoints with the same name already exist.

When you import a route from a GPX file, OpenCPN creates a new route with a set of routepoints, ignoring any existing waypoints or routes.

You can end up with multiple waypoints and routepoints at the same location.
These may exactly overlay each other and you may not even be aware there are multiple copies - unless you shift one of them.

In my case, Housekeeper found I had duplicate marks at several locations - as many as *eight* in some cases.
And if, when editing a route,  you accept the invitation to use a nearby mark, you will not know which of multiple marks at that location will be used.

WARNING: Mutiple duplicated marks are dangerous, in my opinion.  Suppose you need to move a mark because a channel has shifted or a new obstruction has been identified.  If you have multiple marks, they all need to be moved.  If some of them are hidden at the time you move the mark, they will retain their old location.  You may end up sailing a route with a mark in its old position.

To avoid this problem, it is best to share a mark.
Houskeeper will identify multiple waypoints or routepoints at the same location, list them and offer to share one for all routes with a point at that location.

The options presented depend on the situation at the location, as follows

|===
|Situation at this location|Offered solution

|Multiple waypoints none of which are used in any route|Choose which waypoints to delete
|Single waypoint which may or may not be used in a route and other routepoints|Share the waypoint in all routes
|Multiple waypoints and one or more route points|Choose which waypoint to use as shared waypoint in all routes
|Multiple routepoints but no waypoint|Choose which routepoint to share in all routes

== Saving the changes

When all issues have been dealt with, either by adopting the proposed change or by skipping the action,
you have the option of saving the changes back into OpenCPN.
If you stop the script without this step, nothing will be changed.

== Duplicate GUIDs

This script has found that sometimes OpenCPN has mutilple entries for the same GUID.

If this is so, the script reports this and stops.

If you are unable to resolve the issue, you can choose to ignore the duplicates.
Change `ignoreDuplicates = false` to `ignoreDuplicates = true`

== Time-outs

This script may take significant time to run if there are many points to analyse.
It allocates itself extra time based on the number of GUIDs.
If you are running on a slow computer or with limited memory, it might still timeout.
The allocation adjustment is made in the function load( ) and you could adjust it.

== About the script

This script is quite complex.
There is a link:https:../Housekeeper/Housekeeper_tech_guide.adoc[technical description] that documents how the script works.
You should familiarise yourself with this before attempting to modify it.
