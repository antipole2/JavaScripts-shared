== What this script addresses

A collection of OpenCPN waypoints and routes can become untidy and are not always what they seem.
This script examines your waypoints and routes and presents a report.

It then presents  series of dialogues allowing you to fix various issues.

The script is structured in such a way that you can make the proposed changes and only save them back into OpenCPN at the end.
