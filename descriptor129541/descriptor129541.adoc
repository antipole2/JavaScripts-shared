= NMEA2000 descriptor for PGN 129541 GPS Almanac Data

This descriptor for NMEA2000 PGN 129541 includes Greek characters that the JavaScript engine on Windows cannot handle.
It has, therefore been omitted from the built-in library of descriptors.

If you are not running on Windows, you can use this as a custom descriptor.

To install this, copy the raw text of this file and paste it into your script so that it will create a variable `descriptor129541` being the descriptor object.

https://github.com/antipole2/JavaScripts-shared/blob/main/descriptor129541/descriptor129541.js[descriptor129541.js]

You can then supply this as the custom descriptor to the NMEA2000 constructor.  The returned object can be used to parse 129541 messages.

Example code

```
NMEA2000 = require("NMEA2000");

descriptor129541 = {"PGN":129541,
        "Id":"gpsAlmanacData",
...
<rest of pasted in descriptor>
...                  
    "Signed":false
			}
		]
	};

almanac = new NMEA2000(descriptor129541);
print(almanac.description, "\n");
```

The above script, when run, should print

> GPS Almanac Data
