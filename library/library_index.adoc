=== Issues

Please raise any issues with these scripts or their documentation using the https://github.com/antipole2/JavaScripts-shared/issues[Issues tab], including the script name in the issue title.

=== Contributing to this library +
If you have developed a script that you would like to contribute, please store it somewhere online.
You can submit a request for it to be included in this library by raising an enhancement request on https://opencpn.org/flyspray/index.php?do=tasklist&project=97[Flyspray here].
Please include:

* the link to your script
* the description for the table entry
* the link to the instructions file if any +
I recommend including a link to the script in any instruction file.

You could store your scripts and any descriptions as gists on GitHub.
This has the advantage of having version control if you modify it.

I keep my published scripts in a GitHub repository synchronised to a folder on my computer using GitHub Desktop.
They are thus available to me when offline afloat.  I can synchronise any modifications I might make back to the published version.
